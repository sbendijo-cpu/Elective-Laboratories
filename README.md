## 👋 About Me

I’m **Sigmund Vincent Bendijo**, a **2nd Year Business Management student** with a growing interest in branding, digital technology, and personal development.  
At 20 years old, I’m exploring how creativity and technology can work together to build meaningful brands and solutions in today’s digital world.

I believe learning doesn’t stop in the classroom — it happens through experimentation, curiosity, and real-world projects.

## Reflection 
### 1. My branding was inspired by the idea of marking territory in the digital age, where personal identity and presence are established through technology and creativity.

### 2. I chose a deep blue and gold palette to represent trust, intelligence, and stability, balanced with confidence, value, and ambition.

### 3.The most challenging part of creating the logo was achieving a balance between elegance, symbolism, and readability, especially using initials as the main visual element.

### 4. I plan to use this branding consistently in future academic projects, portfolios, and digital platforms to build a strong and recognizable personal identity.

### Profile Banner

## Reflection
### 1.The quote-based social media graphic was the easiest to create because it focused on strong typography and minimal elements rather than complex layouts.

### 2.Consistent branding was applied through a limited color palette, clean serif typography, and a minimal, modern aesthetic that aligns with an academic and motivational theme.

### 3.Readability and hierarchy were ensured by using size contrast—larger text for the headline and smaller text for the supporting quote—along with high contrast between text and background.

### 4.I learned that effective social media graphics rely on simplicity, clear visual hierarchy, and concise messaging to quickly capture attention and communicate meaning.
